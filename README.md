# TheRealMLGang

This is our final project for CIS4930 - Intro to Multimodal Machine Learning in Python
Our group members are Alan Wang, Alex Huper, Maya Singh, and Anthony Yao

The goal of our project was to predict several features of a song, including the song's danceability, energy, etc., from the songs audio and lyrical data.
